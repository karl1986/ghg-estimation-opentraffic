# ghg-estimation-opentraffic
# This program can estimate the corridor-level greenhouse gas emission based on the GPS data obtained through Open Traffic, an open-source platform collaborated between World Bank and Grab, and high-resolution satellite image. 
# The procedures to prepare the required input files were documented in the attached TRB paper which will be presented in the 2018 TRB Annual Meeting.
# The case study was implemented on EDSA, Manila, separately for the outer and inner bound.
# Manila_Outer.py computed the 1-h emission along the outer bound when the satellite image is available.
# Manila_Outer_Process_24h.py computed the 24-h emission based on the flow-speed relations among different hours.
# All required input files were attached. While applying this method by yourself, these input files shall be generated on GIS platform with some manual work and access to the Open Traffic platform.
